# sliding_panel

A Flutter slidable widget that provides an easy to use configuration. Just as you want it!

<br>

#### FIRST THINGS.....
This package depends (to be precise, **builds upon**) the package `sliding_up_panel` by Akshath Jain.

I highly recommend you to visit [sliding_up_panel](https://github.com/akshathjain/sliding_up_panel) **first** and look at it's working.
This package works *mostly* similar to that one. So, for basic introduction of this package, like what is this and how this works, visit `sliding_up_panel` package. (As keeping repeated README feels weird, here will be the *new* things only)...

<br>

## :point_right: How to use sliding_panel:
Please visit the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/RaviKavaiya/sliding_panel/wiki) to see how you can get this working.

#### Note:
This package is in **beta** version. Although tested very well, this *may* contain some bugs. If you find one, please report :)

#### Then why simply not merge in sliding_up_panel :thinking:
I got you, I respect that package also, but both these packages (`sliding_up_panel` and `sliding_panel`) slightly differ in terms of workings (very slightly) and a little bit more in terms of **goal**. 

This package (`sliding_panel`), has a prime goal of providing A LOT OF customization and also some other features (like, work as `modal bottom sheet` and `return some value` from panel).
