#### Easily put your content in the panel, customize it and then just use the panel for various purposes like, 
- Showing some persistent content on bottom of the screen.
- Can be used like `showModalBottomSheet()` from Flutter to make user choices.
- Also use like `DraggableScrollableSheet()` and put scrollable content inside the panel.
